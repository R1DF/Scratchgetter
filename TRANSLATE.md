# Scratchgetter Translations
Scratchgetter is a program that allows people to access its interface with various languages, not just English. This markdown document explains further on how they work, how to get them, and how to make them yourself. There is also a list of downloads for language packs in case you want some.<br><br>
For a translation to work and be detected, it must consist of two files - its main TOML file and its additional date formatting .py file. THe reason for why two files exist is that there are different ways to format dates depending on the language, which isn't something that can be programmed in TOML as it is not a programming language.<br><br>
Translations will automatically be detected when the main TOML file is located in the `languages` folder and the additional fate formatting file is in the `date_formatters` folder. Both folders are visible in the program's main folder.<br><br>
To change a transation, running the program and selecting the "Change language" option will guide you through to changing the language.

## Downloading translations
As previously stated, translations require two things - A TOML file and a Python file. First, the files must be saved to your computer and then you must move the files as directed above previously in the text.<br><br>
The downloads depend on the language pack itself and where the author gives access, but for official or verified ones, they are available right below. **Some translations are preinstalled, them being only official ones.**

## Making translations
In order to make translations, you must have knowledge both of TOML and Python. Please contact the owner of the repository by opening an issue describing the language you want to add, and if you'd like it to be verified. In order for a language to be verified, there are several things that need to be considered, such as the identity/credibility of the author. Verified languages are those which the creator recognises to be reliable, and official languages come preinstalled. I don't plan on making languages official upon request, and I will only assign such statuses to specific languages which have lots of speakers compared to others around the world.<br><br>
If you don't wish to notify me, you're at your freedom to do so, but you will not have your language entered in the list below.
