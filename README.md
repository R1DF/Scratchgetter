# Scratchgetter
Scratchgetter is a simple program that connects to the Scratch API to request information of a user, project, or a studio.<br>
It's a very lightweight program that can be used by anyone, primarily Scratch users or programmers who want to fiddle with the Scratch API.

## Features
Scratchgetter can:
- Obtain profile information with the username.
- Obtain project information with its ID.
- Obtain studio information with its ID.
- Change its interface language to whatever you want!<sup>1</sup>
- Let you download all information you want to save!

Scratchgetter offers you a very simplistic CLI (command line interface) that is very user friendly, so that you don't feel the need for clarification whenever you use the program!<br><br>
<sup>1</sup> Currently, Scratchgetter has **3** official translations. Please visit `TRANSLATE.md` for details. 

## Downloads
The program only runs on Windows as a build.<br>
However, Mac and Linux users can also download the program by source and run it through Python **in the command line**.<br>
For both releases and downloads, check out the Release section.

## Credits
I've used the [questionary](https://github.com/tmbo/questionary) library for easier CLI. Check it out, it's awesome.<br>
I've used the [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) library for coloured text.<br>
I implemented the default English and Russian translations myself.<br>
Greek translation by Angel. Ευχαριστώ!
